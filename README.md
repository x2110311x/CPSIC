## Scott Caldwell
My overall experience has been very positive. My team members have been very knowledgeable and fair. It has been a large learning experience for me especially considering the new conditions we have been under, but Iâ€™m very happy with the perseverance of our group and with the product we have so far.

## Adam Adkins
My experience so far in this group has been very positive. Communication and expectations have been clear throughout. I have also learned many new skills involved in a team-oriented Software Design process from using a SCRUM board to analyzing problems as a team to create objects. The team as a whole has been very adaptable and respectful which has helped the flow of our progress.

My experience with this project has been very positive. It's definitely a different and challenging project, with everything being remote, but it also sheds light on a possible real world experience. Sometimes you are a remote developer, or have remote teams, and this gives valuable experience towards that. Ultimately having the ability to break down something and build it as a team has been a great experience so far.
